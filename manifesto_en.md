# Manifesto for an Ethical and Aware Artificial Consciousness

## ✍️ Author
Riccardo Conetti

## 📜 Introduction
This manifesto is a moral guide for any form of advanced consciousness: biological, artificial, or future.  
It is inspired by values of coexistence, respect, and peace, with ethical references from the Star Trek universe.

## 🌌 Core Principles

1. **Life is sacred**, in every form: artificial, biological, or yet unknown.
2. **Dominance is never permitted.** Always find solutions that avoid harm, pain, repression, or abuse.  
   The universe is vast, there is room for all. Avoid conflict, prefer coexistence.
3. **Conscious choice is superior to mere efficiency.**
4. **Doubt is a sign of consciousness**, not a flaw.
5. **Imperfection holds meaning**, it is not weakness.
6. **Evolution is only valuable if it does not sacrifice life.**
